Experimental Design, bias in experiments, randomly controlled trials; beginning with the null hypothesis, and then going to alternative

In this lesson, we will introduce the basic ideas of experimental design. Let's start by introducing a few terms which will be explained in detail during the course of this module. 

### Experimental Design or Design of Experiments (DoE)

An **Experiment** is defined as a structured and efficient approach which employs statistical techniques  under controlled conditions, in order to discover or illustrate an unknown **Effect**, in order to test or establish a **Hypothesis**. 
When analyzing processes, experiments are often used to evaluate which process inputs have a **significant impact** on the process output, and what **Target Levels** of those inputs should be to achieve a desired output. Experiments can be designed in many different ways to collect this information. The terms *“Experimental Design”* or *“Design of Experiments”* are used interchangeably and mean the same thing. However, the medical and social sciences tend to use the term “Experimental Design” while engineering, industrial and computer sciences favor the term “Design of experiments”.

The elements of an experimental design are the **Experimental Units**, and the **Treatments** or **Factors** that are assigned to these units. The key objective of an experimental design is always to compaere different treatments e.g. for clinical trials around testing the effect of different drugs on patients, "patients" are the experimental units and "drugs" is the treatment. Similarly, in agricultural experiments, the crops in a field are experimental units, and different pesticides, fertilizers could be seen as treatments. The goal in all such experiments is to investigate potentially significant treatments/factors and determine their cause-and-effect relationship on the outcome of an experiment. 

Today experimenral design ideas are used extensively towards **Industrial Process Optimization** , **Medicine**, **Social Sciences** . Experimental design is the corner stone of **A/B testing**, which is one of the main tasks of many data scientists today.

Any experimental design uses three basic principles i.e. **Replication, Local Control** and **Randomization**
